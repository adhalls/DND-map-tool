# DND Map Tool
### Hello everyone!

I decided to make a DND map tool, which allows you to take birds' eye view maps of your DND campaigns, and be able to place nodules that lists important information, allowing you to put important reminders for yourself whenever your players move to those locations! 

This is a pet project made purely for the fun of it, and for practicing using web dev technologies to make something useful for myself! I know there's lots of better tools out there, but I wanted to make this for myself!
